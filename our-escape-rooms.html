				<h3>THE LION'S DEN</h3>
				<p>		
				The Silver Lining computer virus is spreading and the world is now on the brink of total collapse.  Alfred Roland, the CEO of Locus Industries, has been using its power for selfish means.  He's harnessing its search capabilities to locate items of great value without remorse of the destruction it is causing.  To stay well regarded in the public image, he is hosting an exclusive party at his private manor and Dave has been put on the guest list, thanks to some help from Silver Lining's lead developer, Leonard Koltz, who has since gone off the grid.  Jump into Dave's shoes and sneak into Alfred's private study to retrieve the Silver Lining operating core for Leonard.  It's a stealth mission that will not be easy.  Security is on high alert at this corrupt billionaire's abode.

				<h3>FOR THE LOVE OF SCIENCE</h3>
				<p>		
				You're safe for now, but you'll need to do something for your new friend before he will trust you. In the lab where the virus was created, there are machines which will weaken its power. It's up to you to sneak into the high security facility, power up the equipment, and escape before anyone knows you're there.
